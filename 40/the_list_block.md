## The list Block {#the-list-block}

At the heart of providing first class lists is the ability to make an “anonymous” list—to make a list without simultaneously giving it a name. The list reporter block does that.

At the right end of the block are two left-and-right arrowheads. Clicking on these changes the number of inputs to list, i.e., the number of elements in the list you are building.

Snap! does not have a “Make a list” button like the one in Scratch. If you want a global named list, make a global variable and use the set block to put a list into the variable.
